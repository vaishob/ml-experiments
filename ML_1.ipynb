    "### What does the process of learning look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "The human brain consists of billions of tiny **neurons** connected together with **synapses**. Whenever we think and/or make a decision, a signal is generated and these neurons light up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when teaching a baby to identify a cow, you would show the baby a cow and tell it that this is a cow:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cow.png\" alt=\"Cow\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, within the baby's brain, a specific set of neurons will light up, resulting in the lighting up of the output neuron corresponding to the entity **cow**  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cow-neurons.png\" alt=\"Cow\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time, you would show the baby another instance of a cow as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cow-2.png\" alt=\"Cow\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the same set of neurons and some additional neurons light up and these pathways become stronger:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cow-2-neurons.png\" alt=\"Cow\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The same process is used when the baby is shown an instance of a car and told that this is a car:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/car.png\" alt=\"Car\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of neurons will light up and the edges will become stronger (I think the pattern is clear by now)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/car-neurons.png\" alt=\"Car\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do humans learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we make mistakes, someone corrects them and we learn. When we say 'learn' what actually happens internally is that the edges and neurons are constantly being adjusted within our brain, thus forming new pathways towards the intended output or decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can this be replicated in machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **neural network models**, these edges and neurons are adjusted in a similar way (training) using a lot of data (training data) and corresponding outputs (ie data is **labelled**).\n",
    "\n",
    "After training of the neural network, whenever a new input is passed to machine, it can tell you the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **deep learning**, it is one of the techniques residing under the umbrella term of **machine learning**."
