# Machine Learning Tutorials

Welcome to my **ML Tutorials** repository! This repository is a public showcase of what I've learned on my self-taught journey into the world of machine learning. Each tutorial reflects my understanding and application of various machine learning concepts, built upon online resources, courses, and hands-on experimentation.

## Tutorials

### 1. Machine Learning Tutorial 1: What is ML
- **Overview:** This tutorial introduces the fundamentals of Machine Learning, exploring its definition, different types (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), and various applications.
- **Content:** A theoretical introduction that sets the stage for understanding more complex concepts in later tutorials.

### 2. Machine Learning Tutorial 2: Simple Linear Regression
- **Overview:** A dive into simple linear regression, one of the most basic forms of machine learning models. This tutorial covers building a linear regression model from scratch, interpreting results, and visualizing data.
- **Content:** Hands-on implementation of simple linear regression using Python.

### 3. Machine Learning Tutorial 3: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
- **Overview:** Expanding on simple linear regression, this tutorial covers linear regression with multiple variables (multivariate linear regression), a crucial step in tackling more complex problems.
- **Content:** Implementation of multivariate linear regression, exploring concepts like feature scaling and regularization.

### 4. Machine Learning Tutorial 4: Gradient Descent and Cost Function
- **Overview:** An in-depth look at the mathematical foundations of linear regression, focusing on gradient descent and cost functions. Learn how to optimize machine learning models effectively.
- **Content:** Detailed explanation and implementation of the gradient descent algorithm, with a focus on understanding cost functions.
